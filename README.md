# classapp-dev-challenge
This is my attempt doing the ClassApp dev challenge.  
It will receive a CSV input and parse it to a JSON output as requested in this link:  
https://gist.github.com/lucas-brito/84a77f08115ae4b9b034c010ff2a2ab4#file-input-csv
## Dependencies
To run this project you'll need:
- Node.js (Tested with v10.15.1)
- google-libphonenumber
- lodash
## How to
The program expects two Environment Variables, INPUT_PATH and OUTPUT_PATH.  
Just set it and enjoy.

Example:  
INPUT_PATH=path/to/your/input.csv OUTPUT_PATH=path/to/your/output.json node path/to/index.js
